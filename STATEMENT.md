Contributions
We all started the project individually so we used our own AWS accounts. On each account, we all completed phases 1-3 and had our own version of the recommendation algorithm. For the final version of our project, the general breakdwon of our contribution is as follows:

I started this project by locally understanding the data and created a py script to imitate what the final project would ideally act as. In the initial stages, the algorithm used DMA to find events near the currently-searched event which would be phase 4. Then used tfidfvectorizer, Jaccard similarity, and k-clustering to find event descriptions that were similar to the current event. This was the basis for the project. Then I started to move the project onto AWS starting with extracting the data from the zip files and moving it onto Athena so that the data could be analyzed on AWS. My main focus on this project was data translation and I assisted on data transfer and conceptualizing the final algorithm.
