# Recommendation Engine
*Completed by Heather Ciallella, Selina Hui, and Sachin Saxena for [CS562: Big Data Algorithms](https://crab.rutgers.edu/~shende/cs562/index.html)*

For this project, we were asked to create a recommendation engine for an online event ticketing system using a [provided dataset](https://github.com/geoffrey-young/RecommendationEngine/blob/master/data) of 81,497 events, including unique identifiers, names, descriptions, hashtags, venue information (name, state, city, street, zip code), and Facebook information. We were responsible for processing the data, writing a recommendation algorithm, enriching the core data with additional information, and creating a web application to display the results. Heavy use of [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (particularly [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/), [Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb), and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)), was encouraged for all aspects of the project.

The project was divided into five distinct phases, which we will use to describe our deliverables:
* Pipeline
* Display
* Enrichment
* Analysis
* Iteration

**Phase 1: Pipeline**

**Phase 2: Display**

**Phase 3: Enrichment**


**Phase 4: Analysis**

**Phase 5: Iteration**
